# imsg-autorespond

iMSG Autorespond is a script that automatically reads and responds to messages sent through iMessage on your laptop. This requires having macOS and an iPhone to do but
allows you to access all text message histories and know when you receieve messages.

## Installation

Simply extract the three files into it's own folder and locate the 'chat.db' file on your mac. Here you will find all your messages and chat_id. As of
now this program only works with only having one target who you can receieve and send messages to. Locate the chat_id of the person you want to send and
receive messages down and input the chat_id in both main.py and read.py. Make sure to type the phone number of your target as well.
